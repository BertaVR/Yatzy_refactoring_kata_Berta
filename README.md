# Yatzy refactoring kata
 ## Goal
 This is the first kata that I coded for learning OOP as well as my first kata on refactoring. The main purpose of this project was to learn. 
 The aim of this kata is to refactor a Python code used to calculate the score of a given roll in any **Yatzy** category. The original code and rules are in [this repository](https://github.com/emilybache/Yatzy-Refactoring-Kata) by [emilybache](https://github.com/emilybache/).

- ❌ It DOES NOT aim to evaluate which is the highest scoring category. 
- ❌ It DOES NOT aim to program the random dice rolling.
- ✔️ It aims to calculate the score of a GIVEN roll in a given category.
 ## What is Yatzy?
 Yatzy is a dice game in which 5 dice are rolled in every roll. Then the score can be calculated in different ways depending on the category. The whole rules of the Yatzy game are better explained in this [emilybache's repository](https://github.com/emilybache/Yatzy-Refactoring-Kata).
