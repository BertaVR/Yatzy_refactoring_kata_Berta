# Yatzy refactoring kata
 ## Goal
 This is the first kata that I coded for learning OOP as well as my first kata on refactoring. It's a project that I completed in order to learn. The aim of this kata is to refactor a Python code used to calculate the score of a given roll in any **Yatzy** category. The original code and rules are in this repository: a [this repository](https://github.com/emilybache/Yatzy-Refactoring-Kata) by [emilybache](https://github.com/emilybache/).

- ❌ It DOES NOT aim to evaluate which is the highest scoring category. 
- ❌ It DOES NOT aim to program the random dice rolling.
- ✔️ It calculates the score of a GIVEN roll in a given category.
